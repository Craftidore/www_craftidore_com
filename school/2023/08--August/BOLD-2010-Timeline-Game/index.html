        Click each timeline event to move it around; click again to set it down somewhere.
        Order the events from first to last (starting from the top of the page).
        You may check against the answer at any point, and it will show you how far along the timeline your order remains correct.

        I would like to note that this is what I could whip up in a day; there are rough edges everywhere.
        In addition to all the functionality annoyances, you probably won't be able to play this on mobile, 
        I haven't tested this on non-chromium browsers, and if your screen's much smaller than mine you'll need to zoom out (<code>ctrl -</code>) so you can see all the randomly placed timeline boxes.
        And yes, I'm aware this is super-cheesable if you so much as open up the chromium dev tools.
