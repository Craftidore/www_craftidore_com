                Membership at Org-name costs money and such.
                If you'd like to have membership at Org-name,
                please follow this paypal link and include x y z details in the payment.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, I can create a page with info about membership, how much it costs, what it gets you, etc.
                However, using this free method of website-creation, I can't lock-off parts of the website from certain people,
                which means no such thing as accounts or a way to only show things to members.
                You mentioned wanting members' info stored in a spreadsheet; I can't do that from here,
                I can just link to a paypal link.
                If you have a way to setup integration between paypal and google sheets, then that could work,
                but I don't know how to do that myself.
                I can embed a google sheets spreadsheet here, but I can't do that without making it visible to everyone.
