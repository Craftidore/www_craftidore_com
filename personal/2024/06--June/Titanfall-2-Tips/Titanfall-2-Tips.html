        <h1>Titanfall 2 Tips and Info</h1>
        <p>
            Titanfall 2 is a "dead" shooter released in 2016. It's one of the best FPS games on the planet.
            While it is "dead," never receiving another update, it still has a small but dedicated playerbase; enough to get matches.
            The campaign is a 5-hour <em>masterpiece</em> that I cannot suggest enough and the multiplayer is a ton of fun too.

        <h2 id="best-loadout">Best Loadout</h3>
        <p>
            Titanfall 2 lets you customize your loadout extensively.
            The best loadout is as follows, roughly (expect some disagreement).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Grapple</li>
            <li><strong>Primary</strong>: CAR</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary</strong>: RE-45</li>
            <li><strong>Anti-Titan</strong>: Archer or Thunderbolt</li>
            <li><strong>Grenade</strong>: Firestar</li>
            <li><strong>Kits</strong>: Fast Regen and Titan Hunter</li>
            <li><strong>Titan</strong>: Tone</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Now, stop. <em>You can use this loadout</em>.
            That doesn't mean you should, though.
            Use this loadout, or one similar, when you're first getting started with the game,
            but once you start getting top-of-the-leaderboard with it, branch out and try other (worse) loadouts;
            you'll find they're just as much fun, if not more.
        </p>
        <p>
            This leads into something I want to drive home about this game:
            you should play this game to have fun, not to be competitive.
            Titanfall 2 is the most fun when you're not trying to playing it optimally,
            but instead experimenting and trying out different weapons, strategies, titans, and tacticals.
            Case in point, even though CAR and Tone are the best weapon and titans respectively,
            you won't see many people using them.
            There are few things as fun as duping someone with the holo pilot (worst tactical),
            annihilating someone with an SMR (subpar primary weapon),
            or trapping a titan with Scorch's flame shield & chewing through their health bar (worst titan),
            and you won't experience that joy by always using the best loadouts.

                <p>
                    A sniper type titan with one of the lowest health pools and one of the highest damage dealing weapons,
                    Northstar has the ability to rip a titan's health apart with only a few shots.
                    However this power comes at the cost of a health pool akin to a wet paper bag and a high skill ceiling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Northstar's best damage dealer is her primary weapon the plasma railgun.
                    At full charge it is capable of taking nearly a full bar of titan health and it can be just as effective when fired at partial charge.
                    Best of all, if you can hit them, a shot at any charge level instantly vaporizes a pilot.
                    Northstar also has a cluster missile as a secondary damage dealer but is best used to kill any pilots hiding in 
                    buildings or to block areas off so you can run.
                    One of the best things you can do to pesky tones or legions giving you trouble with shields is to fire the
                    cluster missile onto the shield and since it spawns projectiles everywhere it can still damage the shielded titan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The singular most important rule of playing Northstar is be a sniveling coward. All the time.
                    Are you being attacked? Run. Is a titan trying to get close? Run.
                    Is a pilot attacking you with an anti-titan weapon? Kill the bugger or run.
                    Northstar's health pool is too small for you to engage in direct fights with anyone.
                    That being said, don't just run aimlessly, run with intention.
                    Northstar has tether traps which can slow a titan down for a very long time.
                    Plant tether traps around  your escape route and at least one will catch a pursuer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately Northstar's kits aren't all that powerful.
                    Technically Viper thrusters are the best kit but in my nearly 12 hours (as of time of writing) of playtime in
                    Northstar I've used the Vtol abilities maybe 3 times because when you do you're hanging yourself out to dry.
                    I've found threat optics to be the best simply because you can shoot through smoke and see targets better.

                <p>
                    If the Northstar is good will be one of the most annoying and difficult things a titanfall player will ever do.
                    The most important thing to do is get close the Northstar so she can't use her railgun.
                    Do not engage Northstar from range unless you are a legion or a tone.

        <details>
                <summary>Tone tips by <cite>Craftidore</cite></summary>
                <p>
                    Tone is typically considered either the strongest titan or second strongest titan
                    (nothing is more terrifying than an upgraded Monarch).
                    It is especially attrocious due to the relatively low skill floor;
                    you can be an utter menace simply by firing 3 rifle shots then your rockets,
                    rinse and repeat.
                    Even worse, your core is the most powerful;
                    able to obliterate titans from across the map, even ones who are out of sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your shoulder rockets are your main source of damage.
                    After acquiring 3 partial-locks, aim the rockets upward before firing;
                    they'll track toward the locked target, and it's much harder for enemies to dodge rockets coming from the sky.
                    If not upward, fire them to the side of a target (so they'll arc around cover) or backwards (so they arc upward),
                    but never fire them directly at the target, as they then become very easy to dodge or shield-block.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, always fire your core <em>upward</em>, not to toward your target.
                    The core's rockets will follow your crosshair,
                    so use that to arc them toward your target from above.
                    You can also use this to make trick shots to hit enemy titans you can't directly see.
                    If, after firing your core, the target you had planned to hit with it is eliminated,
                    you can keep your rockets in the air for quite a few seconds by moving your crosshair
                    so they never settle on a target, allowing you to find an alternate victim.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reinforced Particle Shield is stupid effective, and easily the best class-specific Kit.
                    The others are fun though and you should try them out.

                <summary>Tips for fighting Tones by <cite>Craftidore</cite></summary>
                <p>
                    Tone rockets are terrifying and chew up your healthbar like almost nothing else.
                    Do everything you can to avoid them. Don't worry yourself with avoiding or blocking rifle shots, just the rockets.
                    Save your dash[es] for when the rockets are headed at you.
                    Count the number of times they hit you with their rifle so you know when they have a lock.
                    If the Tone player is new to Tone, they'll likely fall into a pattern, either firing their rockets as soon as they have 3 locks, or after a consistent delay,
                    which makes dodging them much easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the Tone begins using its core, and fires the rockets directly at you, it's an inexperienced Tone player and you can just dodge them.
                    Assuming the Tone is competent, however, first try and obliterate the Tone before it finishes firing the rockets off.
                    Even if you're not the target of the Tone's core, focus your fire on it, as stopping a Tone from using its core is a public good.
                    If you're not successful in this endeavour, save your dash[es] and track the rockets, trying to dash out of the way right as they start to strike you.
                    While this is more situational, you can also try to find a doomed titan to execute, to take advantage of the invincibility-frames that provides.
                    If all else fails, hop out of your titan and at least keep the Tone from getting <em>both</em> a titan and pilot kill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're an Ion, your primary goal when fighting Tone is tricking it into firing its tracker rockets into your shield,
                    only for you to send them right back at it.
                    If Scorch, use that shield to block the tracker rockets and nothing else.
                    If Northstar, stay far away; Tone's rifle shots travel slowly and can be dodged without too much difficulty.
                    If Ronin, never take a volley of tracker-rockets without being in sword-block mode.

                <p>
                    Cloak does <em>not</em> make you fully invisible.
                    It does make you hard for people moving quickly to see.
                    Consequently, it's best to use cloak before you're in a firefight,
                    to hopefully notice your enemy a split second before they notice you.
                    Once you are fighting someone, cloaking is near useless, as tracking a cloaked pilot is very easy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cloak does make you nearly 100% invisible to Titans.
                    Very <em>very</em> experienced players <em>can</em> spot you.
                    Those without such experience will have to wait for you to use your double-jump (your jump-jets are still visible),
                    or guess at where you are.
                    You can make your jump-jets less visible with the Low Profile kit,
                    which makes it practically mandatory if you're planning to use Cloak to aid in rodeoing enemy titans.
                    If you're only planning to use cloak to aid in sniping, Low Profile's usefulness wanes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When carrying a battery, the battery still glows green while you're cloaked, so never bother cloaking while holding a battery.
                    Your cloak ends as soon as you fire, so don't bother cloaking if you think you're about to shoot.
                    You <em>always</em> want to cloak when ejecting from your titan; you're at your most vulnerable then.

                    Best secondary, but P2016 is perfectly viable too.
                    Damage dropoff is really nasty, but it is a sidearm... though accuracy while ADSing is surprisingly good.
                    While you might be tempted to ADS due to the excessive bullet spread,
                    that makes it incredibly hard to track pilots; just leave it non-ADSed and let the bullet hose hose bullets.

                    This is unequivocably the <em>worst</em> weapon in the game.
                    Unlike the <a href="#kraber">Kraber</a>, it's not just a weapon requiring high skill, it's actually genuinely bad.
                    The B3 Wingman does a pitiful amount of damage (even headshots), has gosh-awful damage falloff,
                    a slow fire rate, and ironsights that make it nigh-impossible to see what you're aiming at.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To kill someone with a B3 Wingman, you need <em>every</em> advantage you can get.
                    It's not enough to notice the enemy first; you'll lose the firefight anyway.
                    It's not enough to hit every shot, even land headshots; you'll lose the firefight anyway.
                    To kill someone with a B3 Wingman, you need to outflank the enemy, hit every shot, have better positioning, dodge their fire, and probably use your tactical too.
                    Every kill is either earned with blood, sweat, and tears, or was a stolen kill.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One might assume from this that you should never use the B3 Wingman.
                    Quite the opposite in fact; it's a surprisingly fun gun to use, in a Darksouls kind of way.
                    Furthermore, you'll find your movement, strategic thinking,
                    and other combat-adjacent skills will improve quite a bit while using this gun, simply out of necessity.

                Handy long-range anti-titan weapon.
                Comparatively low-damage, so it's very important that you're hitting the titan's weak-spots.
                Can also be used to take out pilots (the only anti-titan weapon that's decent at that).
                Unless you're really <em>really</em> good at hitting a titan's weak-spots, don't go for the quick-charge mod.

                    Extra-ammo mod is a must.
                    The grenades are drawn to Titans, so use this to fire at the titans without being visible to them.
                    If you try and arc the grenades to hit titans at longer ranges, they'll explode before reaching the titans,
                    which is <em>very frusterating</em> and makes me want to chuck this weapon into an incinerator.
                    Aside from the range issue, a good anti-titan weapon.

                            Absolutely stellar against clusters of titans.
                            Try to avoid directly hitting titans with the thunderbolt,
                            but instead maximize the amount of time the bolt spends in proximity to the titan.
                            On its own, a single well-placed bolt will do a bit less damage than
                            an archer rocket, but it is possible to do more damage than an archer rocket
                            if the titan doesn't try to get out of the way.
                            Extra-ammo mod is a must in my experience, as running out of thunderbolt ammo is a real problem.
